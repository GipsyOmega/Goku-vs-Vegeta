# Goku_vs_Vegeta
This is a Deep Learning Programming Project consisting of concepts of OpenCV, Convolution Neural Network, and many more. In this project, I have made an Image Classification Model using the image datasets of two famous fictional anime characters, Goku and Vegeta from DBZ. 
The AI model is trained using 453 images of both Goku and Vegeta in the training dataset, and it gives an accuracy of 76.36% on the validation dataset, which is very good considering the complex and diverse images of the characters that have been used in this project.

The dataset for this project was made personally from downloading pictures from Google Images. We all know that the images from google comes in various shapes, sizes, colors, orientation and qualities. Thus, using these images while training will not get fantastic results because of their varieties.

Results:
1. Training Accuracy: 80%
2. Validation Accuracy: 76%
3. Training Loss: 0.4543
4. Validation Loss: 0.5200
